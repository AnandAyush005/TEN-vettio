## Works Done 
    - MongoDB connection in src/lib/DbConnection
    - User model created with username,email,password,role(recruiter,jobseeker)
    - signup,signIn(credentials,google,github,discord)
    - While new user is signIn with google or github or discord then we will ask him role        (jobseeker/recruiter) ==> src/app/dashboard
